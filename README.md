This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in JavaScript: type coercion during arithmetic operations. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to the implicit type coercion, it performs string concatenation when one of the operands is a string.  The solution shows how to explicitly handle type checking to prevent this unexpected behavior.  This is crucial for avoiding logic errors, especially when dealing with user input or data from external sources.
